I am actively involved in supervising final-year undergraduate students as part of the "Final Year Project" module, guiding them through the entire project development and documentation process - from inception to completion - with continuous feedback. In addition, I assess and grade studentsâ€™ work based on their overall progress throughout the project development process.
