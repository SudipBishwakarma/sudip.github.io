I delivered comprehensive lectures on Big Data to final-year B.S. students, tailoring and refining the course materials to make them relevant to the IT industry in Nepal. I also conducted interactive workshops to provide hands-on experience, actively engaging students and addressing their questions. Additionally, I assessed and evaluated studentsâ€™ performance through meticulous grading of their coursework.
