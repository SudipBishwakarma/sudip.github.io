This talk was about designing a data ingestion pipeline for healthcare analytics. It was part of an online webinar, *techWebinarNepal Series 40*. I covered a hypothetical use case for a healthcare company and explained how to design a data ingestion pipeline for its platform. The talk included the following topics:

1. Introduction to the Case Study
2. Overview of Healthcare Data
3. ETL/ELT Stages
   - Extract data from multiple sources: identify data types and perform specific extraction processes.
   - Load raw data into staging databases.
   - Transform data: apply custom business logic to standardize the data into a generic format.
4. Data Warehouse/Data Lake
   - Store the final data in a Data Warehouse or Data Lake (Append or Refresh).
5. Perform Analytics
  - Build a pipeline for data analytics and machine learning.
