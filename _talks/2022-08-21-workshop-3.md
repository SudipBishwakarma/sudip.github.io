I conducted a 2-day workshop on Data Warehousing and Big Data at IIMS College for M.S. students. The workshop was a 6-hour intensive program designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of data warehousing and big data technologies. It involved creating a local Hadoop cluster, followed by hands-on exercises in manipulating data using MapReduce and Spark.
