I presented my paper, "Automated Hyperparameter Optimization in Machine Learning for Stock Prediction," at the International Conference on Next Generation Intelligent Systems (ICNGIS 2022), organized by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology and sponsored by IEEE. I discussed using machine learning models such as Linear Regression and LSTM, as well as traditional econometric models like ARIMA and GARCH, to predict stock prices, and optimizing the models' output through both manual and automated hyperparameter tuning techniques. The paper was well received by the audience and committee members. Additionally, the paper was selected for the **Best Paper Awards** during the valedictory session.
