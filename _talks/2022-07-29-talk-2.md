I presented my paper, "Automated Hyperparameter Optimization in Machine Learning for Stock Prediction," at the International Conference on Next Generation Intelligent Systems (ICNGIS 2022), organized by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology and sponsored by IEEE. I discussed using various machine learning models and traditional econometric models to predict stock prices, as well as optimizing the models' output through both manual and automated hyperparameter optimization techniques. The paper was well received by the audience, and I received valuable feedback from the committee members.
