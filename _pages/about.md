Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a musician turned software engineer with a strong focus on advancing my research skills, particularly in machine learning and music technology, through a graduate program. I earned a Masterâ€™s degree with focus in Data Analytics from [London Metropolitan University](https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/).

With over 8 years of experience in Big Data and eCommerce, Iâ€™ve developed and deployed scalable systems with expertise in cloud computing, distributed systems, data streaming, and data pipelines. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on designing real-time data mastering and retrieval solutions around U.S. healthcare data for [Cotiviti](https://www.cotiviti.com/) at [Infinite](https://www.infinite.com/). In addition to my full-time role, Iâ€™m a part-time instructor at [Islington College](https://www.islington.edu.np/), where I teach undergraduate students about software development and shipping. I also work with startups and small businesses as a consultant, helping them integrate Generative AI into their workflows.

Before my software engineering career, I was a freelance musician and arranger for [Karma Records](https://www.youtube.com/@KarmaRecordsNepal), a Kathmandu-based label, where I collaborated with professional musicians and cover artists.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing sports with friends, staying up-to-date on academia through X, and refining my guitar skills. Iâ€™m excited about blending my background in music with cutting-edge research in machine learning and music technology, aiming to make impactful contributions to these fields.
