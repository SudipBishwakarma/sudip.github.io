This research focused on predicting NEPSE stock prices using machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression and LSTM, as well as traditional financial models such as ARIMA and GARCH. The analysis applied both manual and automated hyperparameter optimization through the Optuna framework for single and stacked LSTM models. Initially, traditional models outperformed manually tuned LSTM variants; however, automated hyperparameter tuning significantly reduced error, with the single LSTM model achieving the best prediction accuracy at an RMSE score of 7.21
